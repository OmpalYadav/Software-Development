🔥 Vision & Goals
I’m on a mission to:

✅ Master full-stack development from end-to-end

✅ Learn tools used by world-class product-based companies

✅ Build and deploy scalable, production-grade applications

✅ Maintain 100% consistency with daily GitHub contributions

🧠 My Commitment: "No Zero Days"
Every single day — whether I’m writing a function, fixing a bug, designing a UI, or building a backend —
I push something.

This repo isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a habit tracker. It’s about progress, not perfection.
